She worries what will happen to you when she's not around to take care of you anymore. Will you turn homeless? Become a ward of the state? She doesn't know. But she worries.\n\nThe microwave beeps, the tendies are done. She places the paper plate next to you on the computer desk in a dark room filled with empty bags of doritos and bottles of mountain dew.

Timing is critical.\n\nWistfully, your mother leaves the room and heads to the bedroom. Once she closes the door, she sits on the bed and sobs uncontrollably. How did this happen? She was supposed to be retired by now. She was supposed to have grandchildren to dote on. Instead, she has her stinky, sweaty man child who does nothing but eat her out of house and home and play video games all day. She can't bear to cut you loose. She can't bear to leave this world knowing that you won't be taken care of. She wishes she could go back in time, tell her younger self to cook more at home and stop relying so much on McDonalds for family dinners. She wishes she could tell her younger self that the career she sacrificed everything for was a waste and that she'd just lose that job anyway in the economic downturn. But she can't take it back now. There are no do-overs in life. She contemplates this as her despair and sadness reduce her to tears. Just as she finally drifts off to sleep, your voice pierces the night.\n\n\"Mom! I'm out of tendies!\"\n\nShe contemplates telling you that 2 family-sized bags of chicken tenders is enough for one day, and that she isn't your slave. But your relationship is far, far past that.

They kept their spell runes in a pouch made out of their dried up leftover placenta from birth, which no doubt you've used them to try and wish away the inevitable balding you will experience in your 40-50's. Seriously, take a look at that hairline. Your hair is so thin I can picture you looking like my aunt Caroline in 30 years. Good luck having to ditch that luscious hair for that \"windswept Grandma\" look. Your smile is crooked because you're not comfortable with yourself and you've got shit self esteem. Grow a pair of ovaries and show us those teeth why don't ye? Or are they so fucked up that you don't dare spend the 5+ years to get them fixed? And who the hell put those nails on? Silver, really? Reminds me of a pornhub handjob video. They look like they were put on by a fifth grader because there's waaay too much space on each nail. Don't even get me started on your fucking room.

He bought a python because he thought it made him look cool.  Believe it or not, he and I were good friends.  We had a hell of a time together.  We both came from fucked up broken homes, etc.  He had \"the Many Faces of Death\" on VHS, and we watched that crazy shit together on his piece of shit 1950's cabinet TV he kept in his garage.  The color balance was off and it made everything yellow, so we watched this documentary featuring real footage of dead bodies and it was all yellow.  Sometimes we would watch porn on that TV, but as high school kids, it made us horny.  I finally admitted to him that I am bisexual and that I wanted him.  So, I sucked him off in that garage on a flea infested couch next to a dusty car that hasn't moved in a decade while yellow tinted interacial porn played in the background.

You'll have kids by 30 and a big house with the nice yard and picket fence. Then when you're 40 you'll hit a midlife crisis you won't talk to many people about and your husband will not be getting his needs fulfilled, ultimately resulting in him cheating on you and you'll get through it. He'll open up to you about special fantasies and use you physically as you lose hope for your perfect life ever being normal again. And you'll slowly die inside. Until you're ready to retire,and put a gun in your mouth in a public place and take a selfie at the same time as pulling the trigger and that will be your Christmas card. Happy Holidays!",

Smoke a bit of pot, drink socially, but never get blasted drunk. You can have plenty of fun dancing, playing guitar, video games, hiking, whatever... without getting your head drunk or high.\n\n3) Don't hang out with bad people. You know who they are. Those who drink too much or do heavy drugs or steal or cheat or talk about their bitches or expect you to be barefoot in the kitchen or expect you to follow some crazy religious rules... You know what bad people act like. Stay away from them. Even if you're lonely. Hanging out with bad, controlling people will not be good for you.\n\n4) An education is helpful but you don't need more than high school to do okay out there... but learn to speak what I call \"west coast radio\" English. Get a good vocabulary and learn how to communicate calmly. That right there will help you get a good job with the city or work as a park ranger or whatever.\n\nGood luck!",
            "A lot of people are saying \"become successful.\" But how, right? My best suggestion to many people these days is: Walmart pays a decent wage, is honestly pretty easy work (stocking is easier than mowing, IMO, and it works a variety of muscle groups), the opportunities for advancement are legit, and **full time employees can go to SNHU online 100% for free** (even books, and if you fail a class they don't penalize you, you just take it again). It's 1-2 classes per 8-week term, so it's manageable with work. The degree options are limited but a business or IT degree is honestly some of the best options for making better wages these days.\n\nAdditionally, the health insurance is affordable, and includes free telehealth, including therapy, which surely you need.\n\nOne of my favorite aspects of the job is they don't care about your look, either. I have piercings and a green mohawk. At your age, figuring out your personal style is a great way to occupy yourself and suss out your identity.\n\nHope this helps!",
